This code is based on Customer Segmentation Project done during my undergraduate degree as Final Project.
The project emphasized following- 
• Designed a model to visualize supermarket’s product portfolio by analyzing the dataset with key performance indicators.
• Employed silhouette scores and the k-means algorithm to cluster heterogeneous customers.
• Achieved prediction accuracy using different algorithms: Gradient boosting: 76.05%, Decision Tree: 73.27%, SVC: 62.92%
